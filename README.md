# swift-policy-template

This is a template repository that can be used to to quickly scaffold a
Kubewarden policy written with Swift language.

Don't forget to checkout Kubewarden's [official documentation](https://docs.kubewarden.io)
for more information about writing policies.

## Introduction

This repository contains a working policy written in Swift.

The policy looks at the `name` of a Kubernetes resource and rejects the request
if the name is on a deny list.

The deny list is configurable by the user via the runtime settings of the policy.
The configuration of the policy is expressed via this structure:

```json
{
  "deniedNames": [ "badname1", "badname2" ]
}
```

## Code organization

The core of the policy can be found inside of the `Sources/BusinessLogic`
directory. The `Sources/Policy` directory contains only the `main` of the
policy.

The code that takes care of parsing the settings can be found inside of the
`settings.swift` file.

The actual validation code is defined inside of the `validate.swift` file.

The `main.swift` contains only the code which registers the entry points of the
policy.

## Implementation details

> **DISCLAIMER:** WebAssembly is a constantly evolving topic. This document
> describes the status of the Swift ecosystem at August 2022.

Currently the official Swift compiler cannot produce WebAssembly modules.
This can be done by the [SwiftWasm](https://swiftwasm.org/) project. The
SwiftWasm team is working to merge their changes upstream, inside of the
official Swift compiler.

This is a list of libraries that can be useful when writing a Kubewarden
policy:

* Manage JSON: JSON objects can be converted into native Swift objects
  by using the capabilities provided by the `Foundation` framework.
* Querying JSON data: the [SwiftPath](https://github.com/g-mark/SwiftPath)
  library can be used to extract data from JSON objects using JSONPath queries.
* Manage generic JSON structures: the [GenericJSON](https://github.com/zoul/generic-json-swift)
  library can be used for that.

Last but not least, this policy takes advantage of helper functions provided
by [Kubewarden's Swift SDK](https://github.com/kubewarden/policy-sdk-swift).

## Testing

This policy comes with a set of unit tests.

As usual, the tests are defined inside of the `Tests` directory.

The unit tests can be run via a simple command:

```shell
make test
```

It's also a good idea to run end-to-end tests against the final policy.

This is done by a second set of end-to-end tests. These tests use the
`kwctl` cli provided by the Kubewarden project to load and execute
the policy.

The e2e tests are implemented using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core):
the Bash Automated Testing System.

The end-to-end tests are defined inside of the `e2e.bats` file and can
be run via this commmand:

```shell
make e2e-tests
```

The tests look for a `policy.wasm` file that is generated via:

```shell
make release
```

## Automation

This project contains the following [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions):

  * `e2e-tests`: this action builds the WebAssembly policy, installs
    the `bats` utility and then runs the end-to-end test
  * `unit-tests`: this action runs the Go unit tests
  * `release`: this action builds the WebAssembly policy and pushes it to a
    user defined OCI registry ([ghcr](https://ghcr.io) is a perfect candidate)
